# Shengman Li

Shengman Li will join the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National University of Singapore as an Assistant Professor in March 2026. She currently is a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University (2022–present), working under Professors Subhasish Mitra and H.-S. Philip Wong. She was previously an Associate Professor in the Department of Materials Science and Technology at Hunan University, China (2020–2022). She earned her Ph.D. (2020) and B.S. (2015) in Microelectronics from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.
Her research focuses on developing diverse technologies required for monolithic 3D integration, enabling significant advances in both energy efficiency and performance. She has expertise in nanomaterials synthesis, design-technology co-optimization (DTCO), and hybrid integration.
Her research contributions include co-designing materials and device structures for indium-tin-oxide (ITO) field-effect transistors (FETs) for ultra-low leakage applications (Nature Materials '19); the first demonstration of 10-nm channel-length ITO FETs (IEDM '20) and back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible logic, SRAM, and ring oscillators (IEDM '19); process innovation in carbon nanotube (CNT) MOSFETs with self-aligned extension doping (Symp. VLSI Tech. '23, IEDM '23, IEDM '24); the first CNT nanosheet fabricated on densely aligned CNT arrays (Symp. VLSI Tech. '24); and the realization of gain-cell memory for high-density on-chip memory using BEOL-compatible materials (Symp. VLSI Tech. '23, EDL '23).
